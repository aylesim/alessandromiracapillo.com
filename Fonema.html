        <h1>Fonema</h1>
            <br>
            <p>Fonema is an audio installation that explores the relationship between artificial intelligence and human
            communication. By processing voices through an artificial neural network, Fonema creates a distorted version
            of the original audio. While the voices are still recognizable, the sense of the words is lost, creating a
            disorienting and surreal listening experience.</p>
            <p>The project utilizes generative adversarial networks (GANs) to generate abstract images based on military
            helicopter footage taken in conflict zones like Afghanistan, Iraq, and Pakistan. The use of GANs is a
            powerful tool, enabling the artist to create images that are simultaneously familiar yet otherworldly. The
            result is a collection of images that not only captivate the viewer's attention but also force them to
            confront the inhumane nature of modern warfare.</p>

            <p>The installation was designed to challenge preconceived notions about how we understand and interpret spoken
            language. By manipulating the output of a neural network, usually used for voice classification and
            recognition, the work stimulates the listener's imagination and encourages them to consider the role of
            technology in shaping our understanding of the world.</p>
            <p>The development of Fonema involved a thorough exploration of neural network models and audio processing
            techniques.</p>
            <p>The distorted voices heard in the installation are reminiscent of what one might hear when not paying
            attention to who is speaking, questioning the relationship between technology and language.</p>
